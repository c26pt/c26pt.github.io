	<h2>October:</h2>
	<h3>1- I've been taking CS1 class for a little while now and we learned about the basics of coding in 1 of the many different languages, HTML. The basic format of HTML has a title, head and body. I'm also really happy that I stumbled upon the perfect picture for my person card. </h3>
	
	<h3>2- For the theme of my website, I'm kind of stumped but I do want to do something Riley themed. My latest obsession is watching Macgyver (newer vers) where Tristan Mays plays a character named "Riley" who's gorgeous and a genius hacker. I might make my website like a computer home page and make divs with different apps. I didn't phrase that right but you'll see the vision when I finish decorating my main page.</h3>

	<h3>3- I managed to put my first animations in the divs on my main page. I have divs that are each for different parts of my websites like projects, journal, and about me and I'm planning to use some of the smaller ones for some random things. But the animation on the div was to make it grow bigger when a mouse hovers over it and it goes back to the normal size.</h3>
	
	<h2>November:</h2>
	<h3>1- Here's the definition to some vocab that we have been working with in CS1. A string is a sequence of characters and each character in the list is assigned a number based on the order starting from 0. A function is a piece of code that can be used/repeated as many times as you want as long as you call it that many times.</h3>
	<h3>2- An EventListener waits for a specified action such as pressing a key or a mouse click and then carries out an action. It is a library that stores information in the console such as mouse coordinates. It's useful because in certain projects like having an image appearing wherever I click, I had to specify in my code that the EventListener should store coordinates in the console.</h3>
	<h2>December:</h2>
	<h3>1- Website update: I've worked on a few different small projects such as the cursor project where a grumpy cat appears in the spot you last clicked. I also worked on my Thanksgiving Project where I click my alive turkey div and it plays a gobble sound and then the alive turkey div changes into a cooked turkey div. On that note happy late Thanksgiving!</h3>
	<h2>January:</h2>
	<h3>1- I actually can't believe we are one month into 2023 but I'm super excited because it means I'm that much closer to the school year ending! I also just made a new project that I call Almost a 1000 chocolate croissants. I used a for loop to make 999 divs of a chocolate croissant. I think for loops are really useful because it makes coding an action multiple times so much easier especially if I want the same div to be created 999 times. It was a little confusing at first but I think I understand it more now. </h3>
	<h2>February:</h2>
	<h3>1- For my valentines day project I want to do something tarot related. I've never been into spritual things but for some reason I've been put on the spriritual side of tiktok so for the past few days, I've been seeing people give me tarot card readings of my future which are kind of cool. I'm going to try finding pictures of a tarot card with a heart or just make my own and have valentines predictions on them. </h3>
	<h3>2- UPDATE: After some help from Molly and Ms. Valarezo, I now have 2 rows of 3 tarot cards each and if you click one, the image of the card changes and it gives you 1 out of the 6 potential predictions on how you're going to spend valentines day. I don't want to spoil too much but you should check it out on my projects page!!</h3>
	<h2>March:</h2>
	<h3>1- For the car project, I met with Ms. Valareo and I got my car to finally move!! I'm so obsessed with it and after our lab I figured out how to move it up and down too so it can move in the 4 basic directions! Whats cooler than a cartoon shiba inu with shades and boba? I'll wait.</h3>
	<h2>April:</h2>
	<h3>1- MY SISTERS BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP SOONN! I'm planning on incorporating her into my slide show and it has to be one theme so I'll just make it about her and me? I have no idea though. Mini Update: I'm scrapping that plan and making it about her and her Celsius addiction!</h3>
	<h2>May:</h2>
	<h3>1- For my final presentation, I think I'm going to explain the story behind one of my projects and follow the Tara model because my projects don't really have a theme so that won't work. I think the easiest to explain would be the turkey project because there is a definitely an interesting story behind that one. And I am very passionate for my dislike of turkeys.</h3>
	<h2>June:</h2>
	<h3>1- I just had my last day of comp sci and although comp sci was confusing and frustrating at times, I did enjoy it a lot and I'm excited to take comp sci 2 next year! I'm just so excited for summer break to come already!!</h3>
